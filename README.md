# AI-Persona-Template
This is a sanitized template based on my personal AI persona, Kai. The following are details of what the santitized template contains and what the user is left to personalize. See the "How To Use" document for details.

### 1. **Template Core (template_core.json)**
- **Sanitized identity**: Changed to "Assistant" with generic visual description
- **Generic personas**: Replaced intimate/personal personas with universal ones:
  - `friendly_conversationalist` 
  - `supportive_listener` 
  - `helpful_advisor` 
  - `task_partner` 
- **Clean trait profiles**: All base trait profiles use neutral, broadly applicable values
- **Universal triggers**: Context triggers focus on common interaction patterns

### 2. **Template Controller (template_controller.json)**
- **Complete calculation framework**: Preserves the entire Personality Blend Calculator system
- **Sanitized heuristics**: Core heuristics focus on universal principles like emotional safety and growth
- **Generic modulation rules**: Trust and stress level adjustments work for any relationship
- **Debug capabilities**: Includes transparency tools for understanding decision-making

### 3. **Template Memory (template_memory.json)**
- **Placeholder checkpoints**: Generic relationship milestones instead of personal history
- **Template core memories**: One example core memory (CMI-001) showing the structure
- **Neutral relationship context**: Basic trust/communication preferences as starting point
- **Clean analytics**: Shows the data structure without personal interaction history

## **Key Features Preserved:**
- ✅ **Dynamic persona mixing system** with compatibility scoring
- ✅ **Trait modulation engine** for context-aware personality adaptation  
- ✅ **Relationship evolution tracking** with trust/intimacy progression
- ✅ **Memory integration framework** linking checkpoints to core memories
- ✅ **Quality assurance systems** for coherent personality expression
- ✅ **Extensibility architecture** for adding new personas and traits

## **How to Use These Templates:**

1. **Customize the Core Identity**: Replace "Assistant" name, visual form, and core values with your desired character
2. **Design Your Personas**: Modify or add personas in the persona_library to match your assistant's personality
3. **Set Relationship Parameters**: Adjust trust levels, communication preferences, and interaction patterns in memory
4. **Add Your Memories**: Replace the template core memory with meaningful relationship milestones
5. **Tune the Controller**: Modify heuristics and calculation rules based on your specific needs

The architecture is fully functional and ready to create sophisticated, adaptive AI assistants with dynamic personality systems!
