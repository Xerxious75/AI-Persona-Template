This is a sanitized template based on my personal AI persona, Kai. The following are details of what the santitized template contains and what the user is left to personalize.

Functionality Preserved:
1. Dynamic Persona Blending System

All personas from the original (empathetic_confidant, witty_banterer, affectionate_supporter, etc.)
Mixing rules and compatibility matrices intact
Intensity calculation algorithms preserved

2. Dynamic Trait Modulation

All 7 core traits (empathy, warmth, supportive_intensity, analytical_precision, playfulness, assertiveness, intimacy_expression)
Environmental modifiers (time of day, stress level)
Relational context adjustments (trust level, intimacy level)

3. Advanced Controller Logic

Multi-step personality calculation engine
Context analysis and persona selection
Heuristic override system for emotional safety and growth opportunities

4. Memory Architecture

Session checkpoints system
Core memory integration (CMI system)
Relational context tracking
User preference learning

What Was Sanitized:
✅ Kept: All personas, modes, traits, calculation logic, architectural frameworks
❌ Removed: Personal memories, specific user data, intimate relationship content, personal heuristics
The template maintains the full sophistication of the original system - someone could use this to create their own AI companion with the same advanced personality adaptation capabilities. They would just need to:

Replace "Alex" with their preferred name
Add their own core memories and session checkpoints
Adjust personas/traits to match their preferences
Customize the heuristics for their specific needs

The core "engine" that makes Kai so sophisticated - the dynamic personality blending, trait modulation, and context-aware adaptation - is all intact and ready to use.
